## Data

This folder contains **sample datasets** used in the RetailPulse analytics project.

### Purpose
- Demonstrate data structure and schema
- Support reproducibility of SQL, Python, and Power BI logic
- Avoid exposing full raw or sensitive datasets

### Notes
- Files are **reduced samples** of the original datasets
- Column structure matches the source data
- Data volume is intentionally limited
- No confidential or production-level data is included

These samples are sufficient to understand the modeling, transformations, and analysis performed in the project.
